# autocompl.nvim

### Goal of this project (in order of importance)
To support:
- [ ] Automatic code completion.
- [ ] Different completion sources:
    - [ ] Native LSP.
    - [ ] Current buffer text (as fallback).
- [ ] Info preview window.

### Future roadmap
- [ ] Fuzzy search.
- [ ] Snippet expansion.

### Non-Goals

#### Custom keybindings support
Most people should use Vim's "idiomatic" completion bindings (See `:h ins-completion`) since they are superior to the popular `<Tab>` and/or `<Enter>` completions bindings in my opinion.

### ~Similar~ Better alternatives
